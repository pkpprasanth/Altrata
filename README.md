## Calendar Requirements

- A reusable calendar component which has a `date` prop.
- The first row of the calendar should display the `date` prop's month and year.
- The second row of the calendar should display the days of the week, one per column.
- The following rows should display the dates for the `date` prop's month and year, appropriately aligned with the day headings.
- The appropriate date cell should be highlighted based on the `date` prop.

## Test Cases 
- Showing the component can take a date prop and renders the correct calendar through a set of component tests. You may use tools such as `react-testing-library` to achieve this, or other methods.
- Good code and component separation of concerns.
- Careful consideration of what types are used in the solution.
- Suitable use of JavaScript libraries and functional programming techniques where appropriate.
 Here are a couple more test cases test the behavior of the Calendar component
